# Dual Quaternion Cube
Author: Max Yu, https://github.com/maxyu1115

This is an implementation of Dual Quaternions, and along side I implemented a rotating cube as a demo.

I've long had the question of what makes 4x4 transformation matrices so standard, while dual quaternions are never used. 
This project was my attempt of doing things with dual quaternions instead of matrices. 

I think the main reason is that matrices are much easier to work with and understand, but other than that, I still think 
DQs have potential.


P.S. the Dual Quaternion lib was intended to be implemented in C, but I ran into too many technical issues with cmake 
and couldn't get that working...
